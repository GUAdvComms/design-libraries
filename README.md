## Requirements ##
1. <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/adobe-caslon">Adobe Caslon</a> and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/futura-pt">Futura PT</a> enabled through Adobe Fonts. See https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/using/activate-fonts-desktop.html for more information.
1. The latest version of Sketch installed on your computer. If you already have Sketch installed, check for updates by navigating to the `Sketch` menu then `Check For Updates...`. To install Sketch fresh go to https://www.sketch.com/get

## How to add and use shared libraries in Sketch ##
1. Follow this link to install the library: <a href="http://advancement.georgetown.edu/guoa-web-components-sketch-library">Add GUOA Web Components Library</a>
1. Open a Sketch file and add the shared library components via by pressing "c" and using sketch's built in component viewer. This makes it unncessary to download the Stickers Plugin (as we used to) 
2. The categorization for this new built in component viewer is different than what we used for the Stickers Plugin. You can familiarize yourself with the names of the blocks by looking at this documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UrpFvUKRmWtNbMUHaXLHDJKKfK0wz-RrTkszcL2j_a4/edit#heading=h.nnmj0k10kfkb
3. You can search the Stickers plugin library to quickly find symbols (stickers). The names of the components generally fall under the format of: \[screen size (desktop, tablet, mobile)\] \[component name\] \[font style if applicable\]
